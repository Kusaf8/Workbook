### **Bio Summary**

With over 21 years of experience on small teams and a post-graduate credential in data analytics from Boston University, I am a highly skilled professional with expertise in multiple areas.

I have excelled as both a U.S. diplomat in embassies abroad and an analyst with multiple national intelligence agencies. In both, I have led strategic-level operations and provided analytical expertise in the fields of geospatial, data science, and human intelligence to deliver analytic assessments to a wide range of customers.

I have eagerly undertaken multiple self-initiated quantitative business analytical studies to improve or eliminate manual processes. I have a curiosity and passion for problem solving. I will analyze business effectiveness, spot inefficiencies, and instill data-centric solutions. I am proactive and quick to learn new technologies to solve problems. When solutions are complex, I have the skills to verbally communicate these issues and solutions to diverse audiences.
